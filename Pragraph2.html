Using an actual job listing from a company in your area of interest, you will create a job
application letter and a resume. For the assignment, you will choose where you will apply,
conduct minimal research regarding your target company, and analyze your own capabilities and
assets. Then you will write a letter of application and a resume. You will submit the resume and
letter for grading, along with a copy of the actual job listing

In a single page, you will write a letter of application for a job. Please follow proper business
formatting, as outlined below. Also, you are required to turn in a copy of the job ad and/or
position for which you are applying.

The letter is your first and maybe only chance to make a good impression, so be sure to provide
all the most important details. Using the information found in the job ad, target your letter
specifically to that company and that position. You should also design a professional-looking
letterhead using fonts of your choice.

In a single page, you will create a resume appropriate for the specific job for which you are
applying. Please follow proper resume design rules, as outlined in the separate handout, “Resume
Guidelines.”

When creating this resume, think of what you want the employer to learn about you in under five
seconds. Look at the organization, the appearance, and the information to determine whether the
document you have created represents you at your best. You may use a different font besides
12pt Times New Roman for the body of the resume, but do not use more than two styles of
fonts—one for headings, and one for text. You must use parallel grammatical construction for all
lists and bullet items.

The resume templates found in Microsoft Word. Some of these templates
use bad design principles. They will also insert codes into your document that make changes
nearly impossible to make.
